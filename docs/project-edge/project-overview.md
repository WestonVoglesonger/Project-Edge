## Description
Project Edge is a community-driven platform designed for university students to collaborate on tech projects, share knowledge, and engage in discussions related to technology, business, and art. The platform aims to foster a vibrant community where students can not only share and grow their technical skills but also integrate insights from business and artistic perspectives to enhance their projects.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Angular - utilized for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: FastAPI - chosen for its high performance and ease of use for creating RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL - robust and reliable SQL database for handling complex queries and data integrity.
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy - facilitates database operations by translating high-level operations into database queries.
- **Authentication**: JWT - ensures secure user authentication and session management.
- **Containerization**: Docker - used for creating consistent development and production environments, ensuring smooth deployment and scalability.

## Development Environment
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code with extensions for Python and Angular to enhance development efficiency.
- **Version Control**: Git, hosted on GitHub for source code management and collaborative development.
- **Container Management**: Docker and Docker Compose - essential for managing multi-container setups and simplifying configuration.

## Database Schema
- **Users**: Manages user profiles and authentication details.
- **Posts**: Handles records of discussions and shared content, differentiated by type (Project Post or Discussion Post).
- **Comments**: Stores responses to posts, facilitating user interaction.
- **Categories**: Differentiates posts into technical categories.
- **Tags**: Enables filtering and searching of posts based on user-defined tags.
- **Post Types**: A specific attribute to distinguish between 'Project Post' and 'Discussion Post'.

## API Endpoints
- **User Management**: Handles user registration, login, and profile updates.
- **Post Management**: Provides CRUD operations for managing posts, with endpoints tailored for project posts and discussion posts.
- **Comment Management**: Manages creation, modification, and deletion of comments.
- **Category Management**: Facilitates CRUD operations for post categorization.
- **Search and Filtering**: Supports dynamic searching and filtering of posts based on categories, tags, and post types.

## Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: All client-server communications are secured using HTTPS.
- **Password Handling**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt or a similar library.
- **JWT Configuration**: Utilizes access and refresh tokens to manage user sessions securely.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on testing individual components for expected functionality.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that different components of the application interact correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate overall user workflows and interactions with the platform.

## Deployment Strategy
- **CI/CD**: Implemented using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Hosting**: Utilizes cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to host the application.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Employs comprehensive tools for monitoring the application's performance and operational health.

## Scaling Strategy
- **Load Balancing**: Employed to distribute traffic evenly across server instances.
- **Database Optimization**: Uses indexing and considers implementing read replicas to enhance performance and manage load.

## Maintenance Plan
- **Regular Updates**: Ensures all dependencies and technologies are kept up-to-date.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Establishes robust mechanisms for data backup and disaster recovery to maintain data integrity and availability.

## Conclusion
This document serves as a blueprint for the development and operational phases of Project Edge. It outlines the technical framework and strategic approaches to ensure a successful implementation and scalability of the platform. Further specifications and detailed diagrams can be added as the project evolves.
